# Makaseh Identity Demo

**No login. No accounts. No passwords.**

Makaseh Identity demonstrates a post-account security model where
identity operates **above the operating system** and trust is bound
to actions, not users.

---

## What this demo shows

- Identity operates above the OS
- Actions are secured by tokenized trust
- Encryption happens before data leaves the device
- Only ciphertext is stored
- No centralized identity database
- Optional public decryption challenge

---

## Decryption Challenge

This demo intentionally allows encrypted payloads to be exported.

You are encouraged to:
- Use any third-party tools
- Attempt decryption or analysis
- Inspect ciphertext freely

Without a valid Makaseh token, meaningful decryption is
**mathematically infeasible by design**.

Security does not rely on secrecy or policy.

---

## Why Makaseh is different

Traditional IAM systems protect accounts.

Makaseh removes them.

Security becomes an **architectural property**, not a compliance checkbox.

---

## Demo Philosophy

> Security is architectural, not policy-based.
